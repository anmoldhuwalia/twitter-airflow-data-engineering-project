This project automates the extraction and storage of Twitter data using Apache Airflow, Tweepy, and Azure Blob Storage. It allows users to fetch tweets based on search criteria, process them with Pandas, and store the results in Azure Blob Storage for further analysis.

Technologies Used:

Backend Scripting: Python
Workflow Orchestration: Apache Airflow
API: Tweepy (Twitter API)
Data Processing: Pandas
Cloud Storage: Azure Blob Storage
Development Tools: VS Code, Git

Features: 

Automated Data Extraction: Uses Apache Airflow DAGs to schedule and automate Twitter data extraction.
Data Processing: Processes tweet data using Pandas for analysis and visualization.
Cloud Storage: Stores processed data securely in Azure Blob Storage.
Scalable Architecture: Utilizes Apache Airflow for scalable workflow orchestration and Azure Blob Storage for scalable data storage.
